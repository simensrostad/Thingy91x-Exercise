# Thingy91x - Exercise
Sensor + MQTT sample + TLS Modem tracing in wireshark

https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/ncs-latest/page/nrf/samples/net/mqtt/doc/description.html

https://github.com/nrfconnect/sdk-nrf/tree/main/samples/net/mqtt

## Goals of exercise
 - Run the NCS NET MQTT sample on the Thingy91x
 - Modify the sample to sample and send sensor data to the MQTT broker
 - Observe in the MQTT server that the device is sending data
 - Trace TLS traffic using modem traces with a dev security tag

### Building and running
 1. Navigate to the MQTT sample in NCS (nrf/samples/net/mqtt)
 2. Modify the sample according to:
https://github.com/nrfconnect/sdk-nrf/commit/4c3c48fb14cfb6ce8922a179a667fdcd10572dbb

 The patch:
 * Updates the sample to use a dev tag (to decrypt TLS traffic in wireshark)
 * Updates the sampler.c module to sample temperature
 * Updates DT to use the BME680

 3. Build and run the sample with the TLS overlay and modem trace snippet:
```
west build -p -b thingy91x/nrf9151/ns -- -DEXTRA_CONF_FILE="overlay-tls-nrf91.conf" -Dapp_SNIPPET=nrf91-modem-trace-uart
```
 5. Flash the firmware:
```
west thingy91x-dfu
```
Serial flashing is not currently supported in the VSCode extension!
In order to flash you need to create a new terminal window and run the west DFU command there.


### Expected log output

### Modem tracing using the celluar monitor was covered in the session with Stig Bj√∏rlykke

### Optional - Subscribe to topic and observe data being received, alternatives:
Subscribe to the MQTT topic that the device sends data to and observe that the data is sent to the broker.

1. Online MQTT client: https://mqttx.app/web-client#/recent_connections
2. MQTT client extensions in VScode - There are various
3. Mosquitto CLI:

```
mosquitto_sub -h test.mosquitto.org -t 355025930003742/my/publish/topic
```
